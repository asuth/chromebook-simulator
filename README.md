### Chromebook simulator extension

This extension has one very simple function: click the extension icon, and it will resize your window to what a Chromebook user would get. Nothing more, nothing less!

### Features
- No overhead; does not interfere with the operation of your browser
- No scary permissions required; no permissions at all in fact!

### Why did you make this?

At Quizlet, the device we see most on our website is the Chromebook. The screen size of Chromebooks is relatively small 1366x768, and sometimes if we're not careful we make our designs too bulky (especially on the height dimension). This extension offers a no-fuss, one-click way to see what the chromebook viewport would see.
